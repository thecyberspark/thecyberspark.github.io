- **Story Points**: These areÂ ways to estimate how much efforts it takes to complete a task for a developer. We use the Fibonacci sequence (0.125, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.) for story point estimations. On completing a task, the developer gets some rewards according to the story points of the task. `**On completing a task, the developer gets rewards accroding to the story points associated with the task.**`

4. **Dev Rewards:** These are the story points given to a developer according to the work and efforts to complete the assigned task.
5. **Reviewer**: This is the 5th column and this column mentions the assignee of the task. The reviewer too gets half of the dev rewards. The reviewer is the one who checks your contributions and and Merges them. If thereâ€™s any issue with your code, then the reviewer marks it, and then informs you accordingly.
