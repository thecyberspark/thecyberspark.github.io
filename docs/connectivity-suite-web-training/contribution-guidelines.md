## **Let's delve into a practical example to solidify your understanding for contributions.**

1.  **Branch Identification:**
    - As clarified in previous documentation,Â tickets with theÂ `<CSUI>`Â prefix require using theÂ `master`Â branch as the working branch.
2.  **Using CLI**:

    - **IntelliJ:**Â Open your project in IntelliJ andÂ **checkout**Â to the master branch using:
      `git checkout master`Â .

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```

    ![External image](../../static/img/cc3.png)

3.  After getting into the master branch, pull the latest changes. This is a crucial step to make the repository updated, and lets you to contribute without any merge conflicts or errors. Type in the following command:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

4.  Now since we arenâ€™t allowed to make changes in the main branch directly, we need to create a sub-branch from the master branch.

:::info âœ¨INFO
For **_CSUI_** related tickets, we need to create a sub-branch from **_master branch_** and for any **_application related tickets_** we need to create a sub-branch from the **_ptx-master branch._**
:::

5.  Now, to create a new branch from the target branch we follow the name convention as: **_`<TICKET NO>_PTX<TASK TYPE>_DESCRIPTION`_**
6.  Taking the example from the above referred **_Image 1.0_**, if we need to contribute to this ticket we just need to follow the given commands.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b CSUI-1749_ptx_feat_start-contributing-to-the-project
    ```

    ### Here, we have some important points to remember:

    - **_`git checkout -b`_** is used to create a new sub-branch from the master branch.
    - `CSUI-1749` represents the ticket number assigned to you.
    - **_`Task Type`_** can be either **_`FIX/FEAT/CHORE/REFACTOR`_** depending on the type of work you are doing, where:

    - **_FIX_**: Patches a bug in the codebase.Â A bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script.

    - **_FEAT_**:Â Adding a new feature to the codebase.

    - **_CHORE_**: Changes that are not related to a fix or feature. These changes do not modify src or test files. Examples include updating dependencies, no production code change.

    - **_REFACTOR_**: A code change that does not add a feature or fix a bug. Simply Refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable etc.

    - **_`start-contributing-to-the-project`_** represents the description of the ticket. (This is visually written in **_slug type_**. You can either write it in this way or simply generate a slug description using **_slugify.online_**)
        <!-- ![***Reference Image 1.01 (This Image represents the creation of a new branch)***](Guidelines%20for%20Contribution%2058e4b8aadff340909bffdbf56c795304/Untitled%203.png) -->

7.  After you are done contributing to the task, you need to commit the done changes to the **_GitLab_** repository.

    1. When you are ready to commit your contributions, double click the **_Shift key_**, a window will appear, and then search for commit. **_Refer the below Image_**

    <!-- ![Untitled](Guidelines%20for%20Contribution%2058e4b8aadff340909bffdbf56c795304/Untitled%204.png) -->

    ![External image](../../static/img/cc6.png)

8.  Once you click the first option, you will see the following window. In this window you need to write a brief description of the commit you have done. **_Refer the below Image_**
    ![External image](../../static/img/cc7.png)

9.  Once you are done with the commit message, you need to click the **_commit and push_** the changes/contributions to the **_GitLab repository_**. **_Refer the below given Image._**

    <!-- ![Untitled](Guidelines%20for%20Contribution%2058e4b8aadff340909bffdbf56c795304/Untitled%206.png) -->

    ![External image](../../static/img/cc9.png)

10. After this step, you will get a new dialouge box, at this stage you need to click push, and all your changes will be pushed to the GitLab repository.

    <!-- ![Untitled](Guidelines%20for%20Contribution%2058e4b8aadff340909bffdbf56c795304/Untitled%207.png) -->

    ![External image](../../static/img/cc10.png)

11. Once you are done committing and pushing the changes to the **_GitLab_** repository, you now need to go on your **_GitLab, and y_**ou will get a message to **_CREATE MERGE REQUEST. Click the button and proceed forward. Refer the Image below._**

    <!-- ![Untitled](Guidelines%20for%20Contribution%2058e4b8aadff340909bffdbf56c795304/Untitled%208.png) -->

    ![External image](../../static/img/cc11.png)

12. At this step, you need to select the assignee and the reviewer and then click the **_Create Merge Request._**

    <!-- ![Untitled](Guidelines%20for%20Contribution%2058e4b8aadff340909bffdbf56c795304/Untitled%209.png) -->

    ![External image](../../static/img/cc13.png)

13. After creating an MR Request, you need to copy this **_GitLab link_** and then share it in the slack **_shared-components-topics. Itâ€™s very Important to announce and share this information with other fellow developers so that they are updated and also the reviewers can also review and merge your request._**
14. Once you are done with your contribution and you have created an MR, you also need to mark **_DEV DONE_** in the **_VGame, only for the Jira Status_**.
