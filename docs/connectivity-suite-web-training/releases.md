# 04. How To Do A Release Of CS-APPS

**Releasing a Version of CS-APPS: A Guide with Code Snippets**

:::info Tip
âœ¨ **Note:** This guide uses **CSLP 1.4.0** as a reference. Adjust accordingly for other versions.
:::

## **Understanding SNAPSHOT Versions:**

:::info TIP
ðŸ’¡ Maven's "**SNAPSHOT**" \*\*refers to an in-progress version of a software project, indicating ongoing development and not yet released
:::

## **Preparing for Release (Pre-Release):**

1. **Create a JIRA Ticket:**
   Before Releasing of the new version of any build, create a JIRA ticket named: <br/> <span style={{backgroundColor: '#193C47', padding: '2px'}}>**_CS < component >-< ticketnumber >< versionNumber >:Â Release_**. Example,Â **_CSLP-1551: Key-value-list: Refactoring key-template to key-variant should be key to reduce diversity_**.</span>

## Front-End Release (apps-frontend)

1. **Clone the app through the GitLab:** Check out the frontend repository of the application, in case you don't have it, clone it from **_GitLab,_** and create a pull. **_Refer (1.0 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r1.png)
   **_figure 1.0_**

2. **Update pom.xml:** Make the necessary changes to the `**pom.xml**` files, located at the root of the **_cs-lp_** folder, within the **`cs-app-uis/apps/cs-lp`** folder. **_Refer (1.0, 1.1, 1.12 & 1.13 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r2.png)
   **_figure 1.0_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r3.png)
   **_figure 1.1 In pom.xml located at the root of the repository_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r4.png)
   **_figure 1.12_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r5.png)
   **_figure 1.13_**

3. **Create a Branch:** After the following needful changes, create a branch with the following name convention & push them on that separate branch (as we are not allowed toÂ push directly to the master). **_Refer (1.2 & 1.3 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r6.png)
   **_figure 1.2_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r7.png)
   **_figure 1.3_**

4. **Commit & Merge Branch:** After creating the branch, you need to push all the changes, with a brief commit message **_example_**: **_`CSLP-178:ptx Chore prepared release for APP Frontend.`_** After that you need to create a Merge Request so that an authorized member will merge your branch into the master branch (as we are not allowed toÂ push directly to the master). **_Refer (1.4 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r8.png)
   **_figure 1.4_**

   <aside>
   âœ¨ **Maven** release could only be performed if the branch on which the developer did changes is merged first on the GitLab. The branches could be merged (***on GitLab***) only by the authorized members in order to move to the next step ***(i.e To Perform Maven release on Jenkins)***

   </aside>

### **Perform Maven release for the front-end on Jenkins**

1. **On Jenkins**: On Jenkins, look for the **_`Perform Maven Release`_** for the **_cs-app-landing-page-ui_**. **_Refer (1.50 & 1.51 for details)_**
2. Set the Release Version to the current version you're releasing which in this case is `***current-Release-version - 1.4.0***` and the Development version to a next SNAPSHOT VERSION which in this case would be `***Snapshot-version - 1.5.0***` (**_1.5.0- SNAPSHOT_**) and finally schedule the build. Make sure the build runs successfully

   **_figure 1.50_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r10.png)
   **_figure 1.51_**

      <aside>
      <!-- ðŸ’¡ **Remember**: Any file name <***CS-APPNAME-UI***> indicates that the file is a ***frontend application.*** -->

      </aside>

   > **_Remember:_** Suppose if we release a version is **_say 1.4.0_**, then the next **SNAPSHOT** version should be taken as **_1.5.0-SNAPSHOT_**.

## **Post Release Update** (apps-frontend)

After the Maven Release has successfully build and completed, you should **_update the project_** in your IDE to **_retrieve the changes MAVEN plugin applied_**. For that you need to go inside your IDE and look for the **_PULL_** command. **_Refer (1.60 for details)_**
![External image](../..//static/img/release/r11.png)
**_Figure 1.60_**

## Back-End Release (apps-backend)

1. **Clone the app through the GitLab:** Check out the backend repository of the application from the search bar (eg **_cs-app-landing-page_**), and clone it from **_GitLab,_** and create a pull. **_Refer (2.0 & 2.01 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r12.png)
   **_Figure 2.0_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r13.png)
   **_Figure 2.0_** From the top menu, a small drop down will appear, click the **_Git from Version Control and paste the HTTPS/SSH clone URL to clone the repository in your IDE_**

2. **Update pom.xml:** Make the necessary changes to the `**pom.xml**` files, located at the root of the repository and within the **`apps-backend or cs-app-landing-page`** folder. **_Refer (2.10, 2.11, 2.12 & 2.13 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r14.png)
   **_Figure 2.10 - OLD VERSIONS and NEW VERSIONS are specified_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r15.png)
   **_In pom.xml located at the root of the backend repository_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r16.png)
   **_In pom.xml located in the apps backend folder itself :_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r17.png)
3. **Create a Branch:** After the following needful changes, create a branch with the following name convention & push them on that separate branch (as we are not allowed toÂ push directly to the master). **_Refer (2.20 & 2.21 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r18.png)
   **_figure 1.3_**

4. **Commit & Merge Branch:** After creating the branch, you need to push all the changes, with a brief commit message **_example_**: **_`CSLP-178:ptx Chore prepared release for APP Backend.` Remember that you will only get a prompt for Merge Request (on GitLab) if you are in the designated folder, i.e. the folder where you have performed the commit and push request._** After that you need to create a Merge Request so that an authorized member will merge your branch into the master branch (as we are not allowed toÂ push directly to the master). **_Refer (2.3 for details)_**
   ![External image](../..//static/img/release/r19.png)
   **_Figure 2.30 shows the reference on how to make a MERGE REQUEST._**

## Trouble Shoot: Important Points to Ponder

1. Some times **_Maven Release is unsuccessful,_** its because the **\*\***branches you pushed to the **_GitLab_** were not merged by the authorized members in order to move to the next step, and hence Jenkins shows such error message **_`BUILD FAILURE.` The build failure error may looks like:_**

   ```

   :::info Info
   ðŸ’¡ You Just need to **_wait_**, or **_simply ask_** the authorized members to approve these **_merge requests_**.
   :::

2. Even after mergers are properly approved, errors can still occur in Jenkins. This is because the app version on **_`ZF confluence`_** might not be updated to the latest version. To resolve this, you can either ask a senior team member to update the app or, if you have access you can edit the version there, and then repeat the process on the latest version of the Jenkins.

:::info NOTE
ðŸ’¡ **_In ZF confluence, you can see the updated versions and information of other apps as well._**
