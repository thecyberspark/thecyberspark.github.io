## **Prerequisites**

Before diving in, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **[NodeJS](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm):** Â Used for running the project's JavaScript dependencies.
- **[GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git):**Â  A distributed version control system for managing code revisions.
- **Yarn (Optional):**Â  A package manager for JavaScript that can be used as an alternative to NodeJS.

After Installing NodeJS, download the latest version of ***npm***, on the command line, run the following command:

```jsx
npm install -g npm //to insatll npm
node -v //to check node version
npm -v // to check npm version
```

```jsx
git version //to check the version of git
```

## **Setting Up Your Development Environment**

1. **[Install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows):** Download and install **IntelliJ IDE Ultimate**, a powerful IDE for developing web applications.
2. **Clone the cs-ui-apps repository:** Use the provided **_GitLab URL_** to clone the `**cs-ui-apps**` repository locally. You'll need the credentials shared with you for authentication.

## **Branching System:**

The repositories uses a branching system to manage different development streams. Here are some key branches:

- `**master**`: The primary branch for all contributions. Specific rules and regulations govern pushing changes to this branch.
- `**ptx-master**`: Branch dedicated to Pragtex GmbH Company (ptx).
- `**ds-master**`: Branch dedicated to Double Slash GmbH Company (ds).
- `**spyrosoft-master**`: Branch dedicated to Spyro Soft Company.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The repository currently holds around 15 distinct Angular applications, each managed and maintained by a specific company.

</aside>

## **Applications and Design Documents:**

For design guidance, you'll find a `**Styleguides (Adobe XD)**` section within the `**ui-demo**` application's `**Components > others**` folder. These Adobe XD files serve as blueprints for all applications, detailing the page and component designs before development starts. Some key design documents include:

- **ZF Design System:**Â Defines common styles for all applications.
- **Landing Page**
- **Fleet Monitoring**
- **Landing Page**
- **Fleet Monitoring**
- **Fleet Configurator**
- **Device Manager**
- **Remote Diagnostics**
- **Mission Manager**
- **Map Manager**
- **Vehicle Calendar**
- **Service Space**
- **Update Manager**
- **Remote Operations**
- **User Manager**
- **ZF ProConnect (Shuttle applications)**
- **Customer Operations Concept Analysis (COCA)**
- **Sensor Data Manager (SDM)**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ To create these applications and components, we must adhere to these design rules only, utilize shared components from the `**[libs](https://vcu-gitlab.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/connectivitysuite/applications/cs-app-uis/-/tree/master/libs)`** folder when building your applications.

# **Development Guidelines:**

## **Branching and Application Ownership in the cs-ui-apps Project**

**Master Branch - Common Ground for Shared Assets:**

The `**master`** branch serves as the central hub for shared components and applications within the `**cs-ui-apps\*\*` project. Here's what you'll find:

- **Apps:**Â Only one application resides in theÂ `**apps`**Â folder -Â `**ui-demo\*\*`.Â This serves as a common reference point for development practices and component usage.
- **Libs:**Â TheÂ `**[libs](https://vcu-gitlab.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/connectivitysuite/applications/cs-app-uis/-/tree/master/libs)`\*\* folder houses all the shared components,Â further organized into subdirectories and modules for easier navigation.Â We'll delve deeper into their structure later.

**Contributing to the Master Branch:**

All participating companies, including **_Pragtex GmbH_**, are responsible for contributing to the `**master`** branch. Jira tickets related to this branch are easily identified by the prefix `**CSUI-\*\*\*\*`.

**Pragtex GmbH's Assigned Applications:**

Currently, Pragtex GmbH is responsible for maintaining and developing the following applications in **_addition to the shared_**

`**ui-demo**` app :

- `**device-manager**`
- `**fleet-configurator**`
- `**fleet-monitor**`
- `**landing-page**`
- `**pro-connect-invehicle**`
- `**remote-operations**`
- `**service-space**`
- `**user-manager**`
- `**vehicle-manager**`

**Navigating the ptx-master Branch:**

The `**ptx-master**` branch builds upon the foundation of the `**master`** branch, incorporating all the shared components and common apps. Additionally, it includes the specific applications assigned to Pragtex GmbH, listed above, within the `**apps\*\*` directory.

**End-to-End Testing Folders:**

For each application within the `**apps`** folder, you'll find a dedicated `**-e2e`\*\* folder. This folder contains the end-to-end tests written to ensure the functionality of each application.
